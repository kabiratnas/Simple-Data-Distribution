1.	The student directory for a large university has 400 pages with 130 names per page, a total of 52,000 names. Using software, show how to select a simple random sample of 10 names. 
# Total number of names in the student directory is

2.	From the Murder data file, use the variable murder, which is the murder rate (per 100,000 population) for each state in the U.S. in 2017 according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports. At first, do not use the observation for D.C. (DC). Using software:
> US_murder_data <- read.table ("C:/Users/kabir/OneDrive/Documents/Murder.dat.txt", header = TRUE)
> US_murder_without_DC <- subset(US_murder_data, state != "DC")
> mean_US_murder_without_DC <- mean(US_murder_without_DC$murder)
> print(mean_US_murder_without_DC)

3.	  The Houses data file lists the selling price (thousands of dollars), size (square feet), tax bill (dollars), number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and whether the house is new (1 = yes,0 = no) for 100 home sales in Gainesville, Florida. Letâ€™s analyze the selling prices
a.	 Construct a frequency distribution and a histogram. Construct a frequency distribution and a histogram.
Florida_house_data <- read.table ("C:/Users/kabir/OneDrive/Documents/Houses.dat.txt", header = TRUE)
> price_range <- seq(min(Florida_house_data$price), max(Florida_house_data$price), length.out = 10)

> hist(Florida_house_data$price, main = "Histogram of Florida House Selling Prices", xlab = "Selling Price (unit:thousands of Dollars)", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = 10)

b.	Find the percentage of observations that fall within one standard deviation of the mean.
> mean_selling_price <- mean(Florida_house_data$price)
> standard_deviation_selling_price <- sd(Florida_house_data$price)
> within_one_standard_deviation <- Florida_house_data$price[Florida_house_data$price > (mean_selling_price - standard_deviation_selling_price) & Florida_house_data$price < (mean_selling_price + standard_deviation_selling_price)]
> percentage_within <- length(within_one_standard_deviation) / length(Florida_house_data$price)*100
> cat("Percentage of observations that fall within one standard deviation of the mean:", percentage_within, "%\n")
Percentage of observations that fall within one standard deviation of the mean: 85 %
c.	Construct a boxplot.
> boxplot(Florida_house_data$price, main = "Florida House Selling Prices Boxplot", ylab = "Selling Price (unit:thousands of Dollars)")
